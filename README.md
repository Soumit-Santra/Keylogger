## 💻 Installation & Usage

### 🪟 Windows Installation

1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd educational-keylogger
   ```

2. **Ensure Python 3.6+** is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Run the script** (Administrator recommended):
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

### 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run only on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.**

2. **Execute the script:**
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

3. **Monitor the output** — The script will create an `information` directory containing:
   ```
   information/
   ├── key_log.txt         # Keyboard inputs
   ├── system_info.txt     # System details
   ├── wifi_pass.txt       # Saved WiFi credentials
   ├── clipboard.txt       # Clipboard content
   ├── screenshots/        # Screen captures
   └── audio/             # Sound recordings
   ```

4. **Stop the program** safely using the configured key combination or by closing the terminal.
